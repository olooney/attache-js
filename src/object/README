This library provides implementations of algorithms for working on JavaScript Objects.  The names and design of these algorithms intentionally parallels those that the standard provides for Arrays. The motivation for this is simple: associative arrays (data structures made up of key/value pairs, where a piece of data is stored and retrieved according to some key string rather than a numeric index) are of equal importantance as sequential arrays and should be placed on equal footing. However, this is not the case in JavaScript, where the associative data structure is provided as the base Object and NO standard algorithms are provided for it. The goal of this library is to make manipulating Objects as simple, as powerful, and as expressive as manipulating Arrays.

The correspondence to array algorithms is easy to remember once you realize that the pair (Any value, Number index) for arrays maps naturally to the pair (Any value, String key). Some algorithms, like sort, don't have natural correspondences and omitted; others like keys(), values() and pair(), are only helpful for Objects are are introduced. Also, JavaScript provides only forward iteration through Objects, so you won't see any directional variants like `reduceRight()` or `lastIndexOf()`.
