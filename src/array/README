Standard ECMA-262(better known as JavaScript) 5th edition (The so-called Final final final final draft, released in 2009,) defines a number of methods on Array.prototype which are not universally implemented.  This library provides an implementation of those algorithms in native JavaScript, as close as possible to the algorithms specified in the standard as possible, along with a set of unit tests.  

It is placed in the public domain, and the author disclaims any copyright.  It is available at https://github.com/olooney/attache-array-js.

It is passing all tests in all browsers I can test.  In particular, it passes in IE6, 7, and 8, where these algorithms are NOT natively provided.
