attache.same() is a deep equality operator. Out of the box it can compare
deeply nested scalar values, Arrays, Objects, and Dates.  It does a reasonable
job of comparing objects of custom classes, taking their constructors and
prototypes into consideration.  It can be extended by registering custom
comparison operators for your own types.  It cannot handle cyclic references.

It is placed in the public domain, and the author disclaims any copyright.  It
